## What is Relativ ? 📖

<p> My name is Maxime Coutté. I’m 16 years old, I live in a small village in France where I’m the only teenager. With my best friends, Jonas Ceccon and Gabriel Combe, and my math teacher (we call him Sensei) we
built our own VR headset for 100$. </p>

<p> I started programming when I was 13, thanks to Sensei and by creating from scratch my own 8-bit OS. Because of an anime called SAO, I fell in love with
VR, but the problem was that the Oculus Rift was way too expensive for me. I talked about this to Gabriel and we both agree that we should build our own VR headset. That got us into the
math and physics behind VR (quaternions, proper acceleration, antiderivatives…). Then we bought the cheapper component we could and we re invent VR. Now using fastVR and Relativ you can
build your VR headset too. </p>

## Why open source ?

<p> Thanks to this project I have had the incredible chance to meet amazing people, including the chief architect at Oculus, Atman Brinstock. He gave me precious advices and I made
a few big decisions. I deleted all the code I had, and started rewriting it all from scratch, better. And I convinced my two friends and our math teacher to put the project into open source. </p>
